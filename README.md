## Introduction

This project complements the literature on utilizing *DALY* as a quantifier of disease burden in both physical and mental health.  [*Young-Min Kim et al*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969711002051) investigates the effect of chemicals generated by waste incinerators in Korea on exposure to airborne diseases, using exposure-based population attributable fraction (*PAF*) and benchmark it against *DALYs*. This paper finds out that *NO2* ranked highest in all-cause mortality, and this effect is amplified when population exposure is accounted for. [*Ad M.J. Ragas*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160412011000468) studies how different *microenvironments* affect disease burden and uses *DALY* as part of the formula to quantify this effect. This case study found that indoor pollutants might have a bigger impact on human health than outdoor pollutants, once again pointing to population exposure. [*Paul A Peters*](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0738059303001160), [*Zhiqiang John Zhai*](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12273-008-8302-x) discovered that *exposure to pollutants* can increase the risk for *neuro-developmental disorders*. This strand of papers contributes to the rising incentives of incorporating quantifiers in health risk assessments to offset uncertainties. 

## Data

We collected all three datasets from the [**kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com/). First, to measure socio-economic factor as well as the DALY of a country, we will be using [**Life Expectancy & Socio-Economic dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mjshri23/life-expectancy-and-socio-economic-world-bank). This dataset contain **3306** observations with **16** columns. The socio-ecomonic factor of a country is measured using columns such as *IncomeGroup*, *Health/Education Expenditure*, *Corruption*, and *Sanitation* of a country. 

To measure mental health indicator of a country, we will be using this [**Mental Disorder dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/programmerrdai/mental-health-dataset?select=prevalence-by-mental-and-substance-use-disorder.csv) that provides the measurement of percentage of population with with 7 disorders. This dataset contain **6840** observations with **10** columns. Each column provides the percentage of a specific mental disorder such as *Eating Disorder*, *Depression*, *Schizophrenia*, or *Bipolar*. 

To measure energy consumption of a country, we will be using [**Sustanable Energy dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anshtanwar/global-data-on-sustainable-energy). This dataset contain **3649** observations with **20** columns. This data contain data about energy consumption and energy generation as well as energy accessibility of each coutry. Energy generation and consumpsion is splitted into different columns of sub-category of energy. 

All three dataset we collected has each row represent a country's measurements in a given year. Our final dataset will use these three dataset and merge them by Country Name and Year. Due to the wide variety of countries and year range from 2000 to 2020, we will use inner join method to keep all the common country and year across three datasets.

## Data Analysis

Our paper introduced the measurement *DALY* that correlated with environmental exposure as well as mental health exposure. Hence, our plan is to investigate how to predict *DALY* using socio-economic, energy consumption, and mental health data at country level. In detailed, we want to have a deeper look at how environmental aspect such as socio-economic and energy consumption have a direct effect on DALY (either due to communicable or non communicable diseases and youth death or premature death). 

For the model, we want to explore LASSO regression model as well as multivariable linear regression. DALY is treated as a non-negative continuous variable (in years). Our explanatory variable will contain as (1) percentage of people suffer from each mental disease (7 variables), (2) socio-economic factor of country (12 variables), and (3) energy consumption and generation (12 variables). Due to the long list of explanatory variable in the data, we will perform prior analysis for collinarity as well as principle component analysis to reduce the number of explanatory variable.
